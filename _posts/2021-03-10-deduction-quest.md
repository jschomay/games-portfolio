Monsters are attacking your village and you must send your heroes to fight them off.  There's just one catch -- you don't know anyone's levels.  You'll have to deduce all of the hidden levels through repeated trial and error to win.  Can you beat the odds?

A game made for the 7-Day Rogue-Like (7LDR) game jam 2021 featuring found assets.
